Find the missing letter in the passed letter range and return it.

If all letters are present in the range, return undefined.

function fearNotLetter(str) 
{
  // This one is plain simple, we just need two aditional variables.
  var substract,missLetter;    
  
  // We iterate thru the string and substract the current index with the next index.
  
  for (var i=0; i<str.length; i++)
    {
        substract=str.charCodeAt(i+1)-str.charCodeAt(i);
      // If the result is not one, then there is a missing letter within the current sequence.
        if(substract === 2)
          { 
            //the missing one is going to be between the current index and the next index. Thus its char code is one plus the unicode of the current character.
            missLetter=str.charCodeAt(i)+1;
            // We transform the unicode it into the corresponding character and c'est terminÃ©. 
            missLetter=String.fromCharCode(missLetter); 
          }
      
    }
  return missLetter;
}
