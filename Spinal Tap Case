Convert a string to spinal case. Spinal case is all-lowercase-words-joined-by-dashes.


function spinalCase(str) {
  // "It's such a fine line between stupid, and clever."
  // --David St. Hubbins
  // The first regexp is a bit confusing to grasp at first, but when you realize it, is really fairly simple, since it will add a white space between the first a second match. The first is lowercase, the second match is uppercase.
  str = str.replace(/([a-z])([A-Z])/g, '$1 $2');
  var re=/\s|_/g;
  str=str.toLowerCase();
  str=str.replace(re,"-");
  return str;
}

spinalCase("AllThe-small Things");
